The MATLAB code “input_files.m” generates the required two LAMMPS input files (“grap-in.in” and “grap-data.data”) for the simulation.

The MATLAB code “stress_distribution.m” can be used to plot the stress field obtained from the MD simulations.

The MATLAB code “stress_strain_curves.m” can be used to plot the stress-strain data extracted from the MD simulation.
